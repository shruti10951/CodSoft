# CodSoft Repository

This repository contains folders for each task completed during my internship at CodSoft. Below is an overview of the tasks and their respective folders.

## Tasks Overview:

### Task 1: To-Do List App

**Folder:** ToDo

**Description:**  
I developed a comprehensive Android To-Do List App with features such as task addition, editing, deletion, prioritization, due dates, and local data storage. The app also boasts an intuitive user interface for an enhanced user experience.

### Task 2: Alarm Clock App

**Folder:** AlarmClock

**Description:**  
In addition to the To-Do List App, I successfully developed an Android Alarm Clock App. This app provides users with the ability to set and manage alarms, featuring a home screen displaying the current time and date, a time picker for alarm setting, a selection option for alarm tones, and a comprehensive alarm management system. Users can snooze or dismiss alarms seamlessly, and the app supports both light and dark modes for a personalized experience. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.
